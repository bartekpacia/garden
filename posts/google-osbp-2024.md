# I was awarded Google Open Source Peer Bonus

A bit late, but I'm happy to share that I was awarded the Open Source Peer Bonus
â€“ a Google initiative that recognizes and awards people who contributed to
open-source projects.

# What I did

I made various contributions across 3 repositories in the Flutter org (click on
the links to see them):

- [flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=author%3Abartekpacia+)
- [flutter/engine](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pulls?q=author%3Abartekpacia)
- [flutter/website](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues?q=author%3Abartekpacia)

Most of them are small-ish. The larger ones that I'm most proud of are:

 migrating Flutter's Android support to use modern Gradle practices:

- [Refactor Flutter Gradle Plugin so it can be applied using the declarative plugins {} block #123511](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/123511)
- [Refactor "app plugin loader" Gradle Plugin so it can be applied using the declarative plugins {} block #127897](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/127897)

and fixing the most-upvoted-ever testing-related issue:

- [Missing accessibility-id for testing purposes #17988](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/17988)

I know it ain't that much, but it's honest work.

# How it feels

It feels great!

I hadn't been aware of existence of OSPB until I received it (which,
coincidentally, happened the day after my birthday), so it was certainly a very
pleasant surprise.

There's also some monetary award associated with it, and even if it's not that
much (a few hundred dollars), it means a lot to me. It's still by far the
largest amount of money I've made off of contributing to open-source.

Thanks a lot, Google, for supporting open-source contributors - and of course,
Google consists of people, therefore I want to thank Reid Baker for the
nomination, and the whole Flutter team for making the project so welcoming to
external contributors and putting so much trust in them.

[^1]: I think that before anyone complains about any open-source project on some
  so-called social media website, they should first make sure the issue is
  reported, and if it's not, they should report it. Only then you get a license
  to complain!
  
  And if you complain, link to the issue, so people can at least give thumbs-up.
