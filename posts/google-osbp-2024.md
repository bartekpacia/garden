# I was awarded Google Open Source Peer Bonus

A bit late, but I'm happy to share that I was awarded Open Source Peer Bonus - a
Google program recognizes and awards people who contributed to open-source.

# Some backstory

My journey with contributing to Flutter started as part of me working at
LeanCode on the [Patrol](https://github.com/leancodepl/patrol) project. Because
we had to do things that no one ever did in Flutter, we naturally discovered a
lot of problems in Flutter â€“ and I always strived to report every single one of
them[^1]. After a few months, I realized I had created a few dozen issue :D

Somewhere around that time (that is, end of 2022), I got pretty interested in
Gradle (don't ask me why, it just happened). I think I read its docs a few times
during the winter break, and realy liked it.

I then noticed that Gradle in Flutter wasn't (`flutter.groovy`) was doing some
things suboptimally, or in a deprecated way, and I submitted some simple fixes.
Then I went on to more and more complicated things.

This whole journey started

# Wrapping up

It feels great. Even though it's (a few hundred dollars), it means a lot to me.
It's by far the largest amount of money I've made off of contributing to
open-source so far :)

Thanks a lot to Google for supporting open-source contributors - and of course,
Google consists of people, therefore I want to thank Reid Baker and all 

[^1] I think that before anyone complains about any open-source project on
Twitter, they should first make sure the issue is reported, and if it's not,
they should report it. Only then you get a license to complain!
