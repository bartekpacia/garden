# My journey to Google I/O '24

On March 15th, I was surprised by an email invitation to Google I/O.

![](/assets/california-2024v2/0 Email.avif)

When I clicked into `cc`, I noticed [Reid Baker]'s email - the Google employee
whom I collaborated with on various boring-sounding Android-related integrations
in Flutter for the past year.

I didn't immediately make any decision on whether to go or not to go. You know,
I'm a student and have coursework to do and attendance to check off. (In
retrospect – I cannot believe I was seriously thinking about not going. Given
the opportunity again, I'd say "yes" in an instant)

After a few weeks of practicing my usual "running away from making decisions", I
decided to go. My reasoning was simple, if a bit weird:

- the quality of Google I/O has been, in my personal opinion, steadily
  decreasing after 2019 (so after covid). Better see it before it becomes even
  worse!
- this may be the last Google I/O (in the current formula at least). Maybe next
  year they'll do it in a more Apple-y way - that is, just play video in front
  of the audience (no, thanks).

In mid-April, I booked the flights. Me being me, I wanted to fly there as cheap
as possible, and also stay as short as possible (because school). This year, I/O
took place on Tuesday (May 14th) and Wednesday (May 15th), and initial plan was
to arrive anytime Monday and leave ASAP. But because of the prices, in the end I
chose to fly in on Thursday (May 9th) – because it was a few hundred $ cheaper
than Monday, and I'd better spend that money on living and exploring the Bay
Area instead for the needless flights premium.

# Thursday, May 9th – Taking off

My flight was scheduled from Porto

This was my flight's itinerary:

```
08:40am Porto -> 12:10pm Zurich
01:35pm Zurich -> 4:30pm San Francisco
```

I remember still being in Porto metro at 7:40am and freaking out if I'll make it
on time. Fortunately I did, and the plane in Porto had about an hour of delay.
In Zurich I ran to the gate only to find out it had closed a few minutes ago. I
was rerouted to Frankfurt. It was the first time I experienced that situation,
and was nicely surprised how smoothly everything went.

I was fortunate to get a seat at the window, and two seats to the right were
free – so I could spread myself out comfortably. Once over California, I could
take in wonderful views:

![View on South Bay and the Dumbarton bridge](/assets/california-2024v2/3 View on South Bay, Dumbarton bridge.avif)

It was a remarkably beautiful evening.

In the end, I arrived at SFO 4 hours late, around 8pm local time. After landing
I took BART to the city, where I had the hotel.

# Friday, May 10th – Exploring the city

## Internet Archive

For the first day I had planned. I learned about the possibility to visit the HQ
from [a reddit thread]

Walk to Fishermans Wharf, SF Giants game

## SF Giants

I'm no baseball fan (I barely understand the basics), but given that I didn't
have anything planned for the evening, I went to see a Giants game. They played
against Cincinnati Reds ([and lost 4:2]).

Funny thing: I bought tickets on SeatGeek, and expected to receive it over
email. The email arrived, but it said that the tickets were available in the
SeatGeek app – and I couldn't download SeatGeek on my non-US iPhone ("App not
available in your region"). Since the game had already started, and I just
wanted to get in as soon as possible, I tried to buy another ticket at the
counter – but they didn't accept tap, and I only had a phone with me (In Poland,
you can tap literally everywhere, and apparently I'm spoiled by that). There was
an ATM nearby, but none of my cards worked. I was so angry and almost came to
terms with my failure, but then a guy walked up to me and told me to go ask at
some other counter, where I explained my situation to nice, elderly lady - and
she _printed a paper ticket_ for me!

I missed the beginning, but I think it was well-worth it, since now I have a
cool souvenir.

I experienced a similar problem at the Dodger Stadium a few months back, and in
the end I also got paper tickets. I think I might start collecting them!

## Berkeley

Berkeley "finals are over rave". Just awesome. I had some weird impostor
syndrome – here I am, a dude from some no-name university in a random European
country. How can I even party with people from UC Berkeley?

It was all very stupid and again, I'm _so glad_ I went.

# Saturday, May 11th – Trip 1/2

## Damn Thrifty

Very stupid practice by Thrifty!

## Santa Cruz

# Sunday, May 12th – Trip 2/2

Then I rushed to return the car at SFO – needlessly so, as I later learned.

I dropped Nils in Fremont and drove the Dumbarton bridge.

# Monday, May 13th – Badge pickup

meeting with Reid in the evening

# Tuesday, May 14th – I/O, day 1

# Wednesday, May 15th – I/O, day 2

Caught by the police On the second day of I/O (Wed, May 15th) I did not feel
mentally well (for reasons not belonging into a public-facing blogpost) and had
to take a break from all the hustle happening at the venue. Some person that I
had eaten lunch with before suggested me to climb the nearby Shoreline Vista
Point. I took his advice, walked out of the amphitheater, and headed towards the
trail entrance.

To my disappointment, I was greeted by this sign:

Since nobody was looking around, I ignored all these signs and hiked to the
hill, taking in the beautiful vistas of the South Bay.

# Wrapping up

Takeaways I am happy that I could experience that. For me, the Bay Area is the
most beautiful place in the world. I enjoyed every minute of being there, and I
hope to come back sooner than later.

I'd like to thank Reid Baker, who invited me to the I/O, and the whole Flutter
team at Google, for making the project so friendly to open-source contributions.

As my friend Szymon once wisely said "in Poland, the cheapest is usually a
sensible choice. In the US, it's almost always the worst possible choice".
