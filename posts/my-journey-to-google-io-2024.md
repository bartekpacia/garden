# My journey to Google I/O '24

On March 15th, I was surprised by an email invitation to Google I/O.

![](/assets/california-2024v2/0 Email.avif)

When I clicked into `cc`, I noticed [Reid Baker]'s email - the Google employee
whom I collaborated with on various boring-sounding Android-related integrations
in the Flutter framework for the past year[^contribs].

I didn't immediately make any decision on whether to go or not to go. You know,
I'm a student and have coursework to do and attendance to check off.[^first]

After a few weeks of practicing my usual "running away from making decisions", I
decided to go. My reasoning was simple, if a bit weird:

- the quality of Google I/O has been, in my personal opinion, steadily
  decreasing after 2019 (so after covid). Better see it before it becomes even
  worse!
- this may be the last Google I/O (in the current formula at least). Maybe next
  year they'll do it in a more Apple-y way - that is, just play video in front
  of the audience (no, thanks).

In mid-April, I finally booked the flight from Porto (where I live right now) to
San Francisco and back. Me being me, I wanted to fly there as cheap as possible,
and also stay as short as possible (because school). This year, I/O took place
on Tuesday (May 14th) and Wednesday (May 15th), and initial plan was to arrive
anytime Monday and leave ASAP. But because of the prices, in the end I chose to
fly in on Thursday (May 9th) – because it was a few hundred $ cheaper than
Monday, and I'd rather spend that money on living and exploring the Bay Area
instead of paying a premium for the flights.

# Thursday, May 9th

## Taking off

This was my flight's itinerary:

```
08:40am Porto -> 12:10pm Zurich
01:35pm Zurich -> 4:30pm San Francisco
```

(Times are local – I wish the flight was 3 hours. It was 11.)

I remember still being in Porto metro at 7:40am and freaking out if I'll make it
on time. Fortunately I did, and the plane in Porto had about an hour of delay.
Coupled with little time for layover, it was a close call, so as soon as I
landed in Zurich, I ran to the gate – only to find out it had closed a few
minutes ago. I was rerouted to Frankfurt, and from there I flew to San
Francisco. It was the first time I experienced that situation, and frankly, was
nicely surprised how smoothly everything went.

I was fortunate to get a seat at the window, and two seats to the right were
free – so I could spread myself out comfortably.

Once over California, I could take in wonderful views:

![View on South Bay and the Dumbarton bridge](/assets/california-2024v2/1 View on South Bay, Dumbarton bridge.avif)

In the end, I arrived at SFO 4 hours late, around 8pm local time. It was a
remarkably beautiful evening - warm, with delicate mist in the air.

I took BART to the city, where I had the hotel.

# Friday, May 10th

## Internet Archive

For the first day I had planned a visit to the HQ of Internet Archive (IA) (I
learned about this possibility from [a reddit thread]). Back in April, I emailed
[Jason Scott] and he responded – and told me to come an hour before the tour so
I'd get lunch! Turns out, every Friday they host a community event of sorts,
where they invite some speakers, and then discuss the topic while having pizza
and ice cream.

After lunch, the trip around the building started, and oh boy, was it worth it!

The HQ building very closely resembles the IA logo - but actually, it was
the logo that came first, and then one of IA founders discovered the property
and bought it.

![Internet Archive HQ (300 Funston Avenue)](/assets/california-2024v2/1 Internet Archive outside.avif)

The building itself is a former [Fourth Church of Christ, Scientist]. It looks
magnificent on the outside, but the inside is what surprised me the most.

![Inside the main hall](/assets/california-2024v2/1 Internet Archive inside.avif)

The main hall has remained mostly unchanged from the church times. There are
huge server racks scattered around, with pew benches taking most of the space,
and hundreds of figures[^ia_figures] of former and current IA employees (each
Archive employee gets one after working there for 3 years).

![Completely accidentally, I found the figure of [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz)](/assets/california-2024v2/1 Internet Archive - Aaron Swartz.avif)

There's also no air conditioning, so if Wayback Machine seems to be working slow
for you, check the weather in San Francisco - there's a good chance it's hot!

![There are 30-ish such towers in the HQ. Each has 360 spinning disks.](/assets/california-2024v2/1 Internet Archive - server racks.avif)

It felt a bit surreal to just casually walk around (and even touch!) the servers
of one of the busiest websites in the world and talk with engineers who make
them run.

Having visited IA, I took the bus back to the hotel and rested a bit – but not
too long, because it was another beautiful day. I went to Fisherman's Wharf, and
then walked the waterfront to [Oracle Park].

![View on Downtown SF](/assets/california-2024v2/1 SF Downtown.avif)

## SF Giants

I'm no baseball fan (I barely understand the basics), but given that I didn't
have anything planned for the evening, I went to see a Giants game. They played
against Cincinnati Reds ([and lost 4:2]).

Funny thing: I bought tickets on SeatGeek, and expected to receive it over
email. The email arrived, but it said that the tickets were available in the
SeatGeek app – and I couldn't download SeatGeek on my non-US iPhone ("App not
available in your region"). Since the game had already started, and I just
wanted to get in as soon as possible, I tried to buy another ticket at the
counter – but they didn't accept tap, and I only had a phone with me (In Poland,
you can tap literally everywhere, and apparently I'm spoiled by that). There was
an ATM nearby, but none of my cards worked. I was so angry and almost came to
terms with my failure, but then a guy walked up to me and told me to go ask at
some other counter, where I explained my situation to nice, elderly lady - and
she _printed a paper ticket_ for me!

I missed the beginning, but I think it was well-worth it, since now I have a
cool souvenir.

I experienced a similar problem at the Dodger Stadium in LA a few months back,
and in the end I also got paper tickets. I think I might start collecting them!

## Berkeley

A few days earlier I had mentioned to my friend [Nils] that I'd be in the Bay,
and he dropped me the invite to "finals are over rave" organized by some UC
Berkeley students.

I didn't stay until the end of the Giants game. Since I was starving, I bought
the worst (and most expensive – $12) hotdog I've ever had and took tram and then
BART to around the UC Berkeley campus.

I had some weird impostor syndrome – here I am, a random dude studying at some
random, no-name university in a European country most people there probably
won't be able to pinpoint on the map. How can I even party with people from UC
Berkeley?

In retrospect, this thinking was stupid and made no sense. Now it's just another
data point in my life that proves to always try to get out of the comfort zone.

I'm _so glad_ I went.

# Saturday, May 11th

For the weekend, Nils and me had planned a trip to Santa Cruz.

## Car rental

I woke up a bit hungover, checked out of the hotel, and went to the car rental
at O'Farrell, where I was informed that there weren't any cars left, so I had to
take BART down to the gigantic car rental at SFO. For $70 I got a new and shiny
Nissan Sentra – not a bad deal if you ask me!

An ambitious plan to reach Santa Cruz in the afternoon got delayed, but not
stopped.

I picked up Nils and drove down the coast to Santa Cruz for about 2 hours.

## Santa Cruz, Saturday evening

> – [Red Hot Chili Peppers][song]

Upon arrival to some cheap-ass motel in SC, we unloaded the bags and drove to
the see the campus of University of California, ~~Summer Camp~~ Santa Cruz. It's
beautifully placed on a hill, a short drive from the city.

![The center of the campus, Quarry Plaza, was occupied by Palestine protesters](/assets/california-2024v2/2 UCSC Quarry Plaza.avif)

![I liked the murals a lot](/assets/california-2024v2/2 UCSC Murals.avif)

We walked around the campus, then hiked the woods in the back. What can I say –
it's _absolutely stunning_. I envy all the people studying there, among birds
chirping, squirrels running on sidewalks and climbing trees, and Pacific wind
blowing.

As we returned, a thick fog began to roll in, and it was getting dark, so we
drove back to Santa Cruz and had dinner at the lovely [Santa Cruz Diner].

# Sunday, May 12th

## Santa Cruz, Sunday morning

In the morning, we checked out and drove to see the Santa Cruz Boardwalk and the
beach.

I'm not a huge fan of amusement parks. I also noticed that this one had seen
better times. It looked a bit old and dull. The weather – misty and chilly -
just added to my slight disappointment.

![View on the Boardwalk's Giant Dipper](/assets/california-2024v2/3 Santa Cruz Boardwalk.avif)

The next stop was Santa Cruz Mission. It's not as impressive as the mission in,
say, Ventura, but it was still nice. We also grabbed a geocache there!

As we were about to leave, Nils searched for "ice cream" on Google Maps and we
went to the place that had the highest rating – Marianne's Ice Cream. This
rating thing actually works – we found a true local gem.

The clock was ticking though, and my 24h car rental was due in a few hours, so
before noon we left Santa Cruz and rushed to Fremont (where Nils lives), with a
quick stop for In-N-Out.

As I later learned, we didn't have to rush so hard – the clock starts ticking
when I actually pick up the car, not from the time I selected when making a
reservation on Booking.com.

> **Mistake made**
>
> Never ask for animal style In-N-Out if you're not gonna eat it right away.
> Otherwise it will be absolutely ruined! The sauce thickens very fast and it's
> honestly quite disguisting once it's cold.

## Back to San Francisco

Having returned the car, I went back to the city, where I met with my friend
Szymon (or rather, he came to pick me up in his car). We wanted to drive to Twin
Peaks (since I hadn't been there yet), but it was a foggy day again, so we
settled for Tank Hill, which was happily just below the fog level yet still
provided great view of the area.

![View on Mission District from the Tank Hill](/assets/california-2024v2/3 View from Tank Hill.avif)

Then we spend some time in Dolores Park, and then drove Battery Spencer vista
point, on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge.

![Pacific Ocean, as seen from Battery Spencer](/assets/california-2024v2/3 Pacific Ocean from Battery Spencer.avif)

## Aurora borealis

At night, I went to see the northern lights ([aurora borealis]) with some
friends I met at the Friday party. Again, there was thick fog everywhere, so
thick we could barely see the lights of cars passing the bridge, let alone
aurora.

Still, it was hella fun.

I ended up being at Battery Spencer twice on that day.

# Monday, May 13th

I woke up in the morning and took Caltrain from the SF station down to Mountain
View.

## Badge pickup

I walked[^mv] from the train station to near the Shoreline Amphitheatre, where
the badge pickup facilities were located.

In addition the badge, I got a water bottle, a T-shirt, and a blouse (which I
lost the next day).

![My badge, with GBikes in the background](/assets/california-2024v2/4 Got the badge.avif)

## Meeting with Reid

On Monday evening, Reid and me met up and had a dinner at the superb [Milagros Latin Kitchen restaurant][restaurant] in Redwood City.

# Tuesday, May 14th

## Google I/O, day 1

I woke up in the morning and took Caltrain from the SF station down to Mountain
View.

There was a huge line at the venue. Me and hundreds other people were admitted
late because of Palestine protesters who blocked one of the entrances.

![Some of the banners mentioned [Project Nimbus]](/assets/california-2024v2/5 Palestine protesters.avif)

Overall, this was one of the best organized events I've attended to date. Lots
of great food, drinks, and activities. I've got to admit I had a bit too many
Bud Lights.

![Watching the main keynote](/assets/california-2024v2/5 Sitting at IO.avif)

The best thing was meeting IRL the people who previously had only been GitHub
usernames to me. I met guys from the triage team at Codemagic. I met Google
engineers who work on the Flutter framework every day. I met many other community
members whom I recognized from GitHub issues.

All in all, it was a very fun day. In addition to watching the main keynote and
developer keynote, I attended a few additional developer-focused sessions. On
one of them, I (accidentally) sat next to [Hixie], the Flutter project lead. It
was humbling.

As the sun began to set, I took Caltrain back to SF.

# Wednesday, May 15th

## Google I/O, day 2

I woke up in the morning, packed my things, left the hotel and took Caltrain
from the SF station down to Mountain View, one last time.

## Arrested (almost)

On that day, I didn't feel well and had to take a break from all the hustle
happening at the venue. Some person that I had eaten lunch with suggested me to
climb the nearby Shoreline Vista Point. I took his advice, walked out of the
amphitheater, and headed towards the trail entrance.

To my disappointment, I was greeted by this sign:

![Yes, the bird is real](/assets/california-2024v2/6 Vista Point closed.avif)

Since nobody was around, I ignored all those signs and hiked to the hill, taking
in the beautiful vistas of the South Bay.

It was a very pleasant short hike (~20min). After reaching the top, I lay on the
grass and was marveling the area.

After a short while, some dude came along. He seemed to be just another rogue
tourist. We chatted for a bit and then he walked away. It was only then that I
noticed he had an earphone in one ear. This made me a bit suspicious, but I
ignored it and just kept sitting there.

But then, after ~5 minutes, a police patrol drove up the hill in a big quad.
Guys were fully geared-up, looking like they were going to fight in a war.

One of them said that I'm lucky he's in a good mood today, that he's not angry
but I cannot be here - and then they offered me a ride back to the venue. We
chatted a bit on the way down the hill. Overall, it was... fun?

Looking back, my behavior was just plain stupid, but fortunately, the odds
seemed to be in my favor on that day.

## Departure

After that little excursion, I went back to the venue for a while, mainly to say
bye to friends and take some more photos (and eat more free food, hehe).

![The last photo at the I/O sign](/assets/california-2024v2/6 Photo at the IO sign.avif)

I mentioned I had lost a blouse from the welcome pack the day before.
Fortunately, my friend [Bruno] gave me his blouse. He said he doesn't care about
swag (I do). Bruno – thank you!

After a few hours, I arrived at SFO, and that was the end of it.

# Wrapping up

I feel happy and grateful that I could experience everything I did during those
few days.

For me, the Bay Area is the most beautiful place in the world. I enjoyed every
minute of being there, and I hope to come back sooner than later.
