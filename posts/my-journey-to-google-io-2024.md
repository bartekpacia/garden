# My journey to Google I/O '24

On March 15th, I was surprised by an email invitation to Google I/O.

![](/assets/california-2024v2/0 Email.avif)

When I clicked into `cc`, I noticed [Reid Baker]'s email - the Google employee
whom I collaborated with on various boring-sounding Android-related integrations
in Flutter for the past year.

I didn't immediately make any decision on whether to go or not to go. You know,
I'm a student and have coursework to do and attendance to check off. (In
retrospect – I cannot believe I was seriously thinking about not going. Given
the opportunity again, I'd say "yes" in an instant)

After a few weeks of practicing my usual "running away from making decisions", I
decided to go. My reasoning was simple, if a bit weird:

- the quality of Google I/O has been, in my personal opinion, steadily
  decreasing after 2019 (so after covid). Better see it before it becomes even
  worse!
- this may be the last Google I/O (in the current formula at least). Maybe next
  year they'll do it in a more Apple-y way - that is, just play video in front
  of the audience (no, thanks).

In mid-April, I booked the flights. Me being me, I wanted to fly there as cheap
as possible, and also stay as short as possible (because school). This year, I/O
took place on Tuesday (May 14th) and Wednesday (May 15th), and initial plan was
to arrive anytime Monday and leave ASAP. But because of the prices, in the end I
chose to fly in on Thursday (May 9th) – because it was a few hundred $ cheaper
than Monday, and I prefer spend that money on living and exploring the Bay
Area instead for the needless flights premium.

# Thursday, May 9th – Taking off

My flight was scheduled from Porto

This was my flight's itinerary:

```
08:40am Porto -> 12:10pm Zurich
01:35pm Zurich -> 4:30pm San Francisco
```

I remember still being in Porto metro at 7:40am and freaking out if I'll make it
on time. Fortunately I did, and the plane in Porto had about an hour of delay.
In Zurich I ran to the gate only to find out it had closed a few minutes ago. I
was rerouted to Frankfurt. It was the first time I experienced that situation,
and was nicely surprised how smoothly everything went.

I was fortunate to get a seat at the window, and two seats to the right were
free – so I could spread myself out comfortably. Once over California, I could
take in wonderful views:

It was a remarkably beautiful evening.

In the end, I arrived at SFO 4 hours late, around 8pm local time. After landing
I took BART to the city, where I had the hotel.

# Friday, May 10th – Exploring the city

## Internet Archive

For the first day I had planned a visit to Internet Archive's HQ (I learned
about this possibility from [a reddit thread]).

![Internet Archive HQ](/assets/california-2024v2/4 Internet Archive.avif)

It felt a bit surreal to just casually walk around (and even touch!) the servers
of the busiest websites in the world and talk with the handful of brilliant
engineers who make them run.

Some takeways from that visit:

- Archive's mission is becoming harder in the present age of so-called social
  media's increasing dominance.

- Modern social media is an illusion of shared experience. It is not shared at
  all. Our society is built on having shared experience - but because of social
  media, it's going away.

Walk to Fishermans Wharf, SF Giants game

## SF Giants

I'm no baseball fan (I barely understand the basics), but given that I didn't
have anything planned for the evening, I went to see a Giants game. They played
against Cincinnati Reds ([and lost 4:2]).

Funny thing: I bought tickets on SeatGeek, and expected to receive it over
email. The email arrived, but it said that the tickets were available in the
SeatGeek app – and I couldn't download SeatGeek on my non-US iPhone ("App not
available in your region"). Since the game had already started, and I just
wanted to get in as soon as possible, I tried to buy another ticket at the
counter – but they didn't accept tap, and I only had a phone with me (In Poland,
you can tap literally everywhere, and apparently I'm spoiled by that). There was
an ATM nearby, but none of my cards worked. I was so angry and almost came to
terms with my failure, but then a guy walked up to me and told me to go ask at
some other counter, where I explained my situation to nice, elderly lady - and
she _printed a paper ticket_ for me!

I missed the beginning, but I think it was well-worth it, since now I have a
cool souvenir.

I experienced a similar problem at the Dodger Stadium a few months back, and in
the end I also got paper tickets. I think I might start collecting them!

## Berkeley

A few days earlier I had mentioned to my friend [Nils] that I'd be in the Bay,
and he dropped me the invite to "finals are over rave" organized by some UC
Berkeley students.

I didn't stay until the end of the Giants game and took tram and then BART to
Berkeley.

I had some weird impostor syndrome – here I am, a random dude from some random,
no-name university in a random European country. How can I even party with
people from UC Berkeley?

In retrospect, it was all very stupid thinking. Just another reason to always
try get out of comfort zone.

I'm _so glad_ I went.

# Saturday, May 11th – Trip 1/2

## Car rental

I woke up a bit hungover and checked out of the hotel, and went to the car rental
at O'Farrell, where I was informed that there weren't any cars left, so I had to
take BART down to SFO to the gigantic car rental.

An ambitious plan to reach Santa Cruz in the afternoon got delayed.

## Santa Cruz

We walked for a few hours around the absolutely stunning UC ~~Summer Camp~~
Santa Cruz campus.

# Sunday, May 12th – Trip 2/2

Then I rushed to return the car at SFO – needlessly so, as I later learned.

I dropped off Nils in Fremont and drove the Dumbarton bridge.

# Monday, May 13th – Badge pickup

## Badge pickup

Took Caltrain to Mountain View to pick up my badge.

## Meeting with Reid

On Monday evening, Reid and me met up for the first time.

We had a dinner at the superb [Milagros Latin Kitchen restaurant][restaurant] in
Redwood City.

# Tuesday, May 14th – I/O, day 1

Me (and hundreds other people) were admitted late because of Palestine
protesters who blocked one of the entrances.

![Watching the main keynote](/assets/california-2024v2/9 Sitting at IO.avif)

# Wednesday, May 15th – I/O, day 2

Caught by the police On the second day of I/O (Wed, May 15th) I did not feel
mentally well (for reasons not belonging into a public-facing blogpost) and had
to take a break from all the hustle happening at the venue. Some person that I
had eaten lunch with before suggested me to climb the nearby Shoreline Vista
Point. I took his advice, walked out of the amphitheater, and headed towards the
trail entrance.

To my disappointment, I was greeted by this sign:

![Yes, the bird was alive](/assets/california-2024v2/12 Vista Point closed.avif)

Since nobody was looking around, I ignored all these signs and hiked to the
hill, taking in the beautiful vistas of the South Bay.

# Wrapping up

I feel happy that I could experience that. For me, the Bay Area is the
most beautiful place in the world. I enjoyed every minute of being there, and I
hope to come back sooner than later.

I'd like to thank Reid Baker, who invited me to the I/O, and the whole Flutter
team at Google, for making the project so friendly to open-source contributions.

sensible choice. In the US, it's almost always the worst possible choice".
