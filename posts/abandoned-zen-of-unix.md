# Short thought on "The Zen of Unix"

I wish more things in software adhered to [Unix Philosophy]. At the same time, I
know it won't happen.

That's because software doesn't exist for the sake of being beautiful, clean,
and delightful, for the sake of being art. It mostly exists to bring money to
someone, and being useful is just a way to achieve that.

That saddens me.

But hey, at least a bit of that money trickles down to me.
