# Let's start over

So, here it is. My own digital garden that is not dead.

It could be called a blog, but I'll not use this word since this word has always
been putting too much pressure on me, and I ended up accumulating endless "not
good enough" write-ups in my Notion.

I reserve the right to update contents of my articles at any time, but I will
not break URLs.
