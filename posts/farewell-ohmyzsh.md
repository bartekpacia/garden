# Intro

I discovered Oh My Zsh in May 2019, when I bought my first MacBook with most of
my savings – high-school scholarship money, money I'd gotten for birthday. My
parents also helped me. It was expensive shit, but it was a also a wonderful
machine.

I had always been using Windows before. My only exposure to Unix shells was a
bit of Raspberry Pi Zero. As pretty much everyone, I was initially taken aback
by terminal.

But I started learning how to make the most out of my new machine. I quickly
discoverd Oh My Zsh.

# what i want to convey

OhMyZsh is absolutely wonderful if you're new to the terminal. It's quick to
install, and it takes a boring black box with white text into something much
more enjoyable, playful, and interactive. Just easier to use. More fun.

[Oh My Zsh's website](https://ohmyz.sh) is right – it does make you shout **"Oh my
ZSH!"**.

It shows you that terminal doesn't have to be annoying and boring. That it can
be awesome.

# What I don't like

Overall, I think as I get older (and more experienced), I appreciate simplicity
even more. Whereas younger me would customize the shit out of every tool he'd
used, present me prefers to install as little as possible, just enough to
achieve comfortable workflow. Instead of instantly changing the defaults, I now
stop and think "why those are the defaults? Maybe someone smarter than me
decided it's a good default"?

For a few years now I've not been using OhMyZsh's the most popular plugin –
`git`. There's just _so much stuff_ in there. I copied stuff I use into my
personal thing.

### List of specific problems I have
- too much stuff I don't need (and don't have time to understand)
- reproducibility of some bugs (mostly related to shell-completion)
- Shell aliases are cool, but when a tool (like `git`) has its own aliasing
system, I'd just use that.

I realize that not stopping to use OhMyZsh will require some time investment.
However, I just like dabbling at the command line. I'm making a conscious
decision to not use OhMyZsh, to peel off one more layer that sits between me and
the thing I'm trying to learn.

Farewell, good friend. It's not you, it's me. I changed. I'll always think
fondly of you.
