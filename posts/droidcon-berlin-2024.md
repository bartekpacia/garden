# Going to Berlin for Droidcon/Fluttercon

In the beginning of July (from 3rd to 5th) I went to Berlin to attend the joint
Droidcon/Fluttercon conference.

It was my second time attending that event. Last year I was a speaker, but this
time my CFP unfortunately didn't make it through. When I learned that, I decided
to not go, but then my good friend [Albert](https://github.com/Albert221) had 1
spare ticket that he gave me (he was a speaker, and speakers get 1 ticket to
share). I'm very grateful for that, and that made me go.

Being a regular attendee was pretty cool – I was not stressed at all, my only
responsibility being attending as much good talks as possible and learning a
lot.

### AOSP Development Environment: best practices, tips, and tricks

by:
- Roman Illarionov, Senior Software Engineer @ Paradox Cat 
- Viktor Mukha, Principal Software Architect @ Paradox Cat

It was a really great talk and it expanded my perspective on what does
development of AOSP looks like – tl;dr it requires tons of CPUs, RAM, and
patience.

There are not many established development environment practices about AOSP
development, so speakers shared how they do it at Paradox Cat.

They also shared 2 useful VSCode extensions

### Unconference | Addressing package ecosystem fragmentation

Package Ecosystem Summit sesssion

### Speechless Slide Karaoke with Chet Haase

Now, I have to share something: if there's someone I could call a programming
idol of mine, it'd be Chet Haase. I've been following him since 2018, when I was
still in junior high school and trying to build my first Android apps.

I always loved his talks with Romain Guy at Google I/O.

I didn't have an opportunity to go and talk to him in person. Still, knowing he
attended the same event was... I don't know, cool?

## Summing up

Overall I'm glad I attended. This year I really tried to make notes, and writing
this 1 week after the event, I see it was beneficial. I'd have forgetten so much
if I hadn't been writing this stuff down!

The worst part was definitely food that was provided on the venue – but for a
different reason that last year. Last year the food was just bad. After waiting
in a long queue, I took a few bites and threw it away.

This year quality was much better – they had a whole floor for food trucks – but
there was not enough of it. On 2 out of 3 days, I didn't manage to get lunch,
because they literally run out of them.

Aside from that little hiccup, I'm glad I went. It was a great event.
