# Google Code-in 2018

An amazing adventure.

# The thriller-like introduction

It was a rainy and foggy Friday, the last in year 2018. I was home alone. I woke
up at 10AM, feeling awfully tired because of playing Battlefield V till late
night. I dressed up, washed my face with cold water and checked my phone. There
was a bunch of notifications, as always. I would almost delete all of them, but
suddenly something catched my eye. A single Gmail notification increased my
heart rate by tens of percent. It said‚Ä¶

# The actual beggining

I assume you know what [Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com) is as
you're reading this, but if you don't, then...

> Google Code-in is a global, online contest introducing teenagers to the world
> of open source development.

I learned about it at the beggining of the summer. I read a post somewhere on
Medium and almost immediately decided to take part in the contest. But a week or
two later... I simply forgot about it. Ya know, summertime...

It came to my head again in September, but unfortunately I wasn't doing almost
anything to prepare myself. I had tons of schoolwork and other things to do.

# And then it came

_Twenty-third October_

I remember I wasn't in a good mood on that day. I was sick and lying in bed for
a few days, and was even thinking if I should participate in the contest. But
eventually I opened GCI website, signed up and examined the list of
organizations. I went up for [**JBoss Community**][jboss], because they had lots
of Android-related tasks and Android is my favorite platform, so the choice was
kinda easy. After a while I uploaded the required Parental Consent (filled by my
Mum) and was good to go.

I decided to do [something easy] to start with, but I also kept in mind that
quality is more important than quantity. I mean, I was aware I'll have to do
harder tasks in order to have chances to receive something more than a Google
T-Shirt ;)

# Tasks

At this point it seems OK to talk about one of the essentials of GCI, that is
tasks. There were lots of them, about 40% related to Android, 40% to Web
Development (mainly Angular), and 20% to ‚Äúother things‚Äù. The difficulty level
was differential: some tasks (like the aforementioned ‚ÄúSetup Git and a GitHub
account‚Äù) were very easy, but most were on the level I'd describe as ‚Äúmedium‚Äù
and ‚Äúa bit harder than medium‚Äù. By these words, I mean a task that required some
research and/or learning a new concept and applying that newly-gained knowledge
in practice.

In my opinion, there weren't any "very hard" tasks.

Overall, I've done 38 tasks, the last being submitted 1 hour before the deadline
üòÇ

![Coding [JBoss app][jboss_repo]](/assets/gci-2018/Coding JBoss app.avif)

My favorite task was (I say it without any doubt) creating a JBoss App. I like
it that much because it allowed me to be creative and do things my own way. It
had three stages:

- [Stage 1][stage1]
- [Stage 2][stage2]
- [Stage 3][stage3]

The task also required to record a short video presentation of the app and
[upload it to YouTube][ytvid], which I liked a lot too.

![Coding [Telegram Bot][telegram_repo] at school](/assets/gci-2018/Coding Telegram Bot.avif)

I also liked [the task which required students to create their own Telegram
Bot][task_telegram_bot]. I found it very interesting and fun to create. I even
took my laptop to school and were coding after lessons. Thanks to this task, my
JavaScript skills improved and I started using Telegram üëç

Of course there were much more great tasks, but these 2 were the best. Now a few
examples of what I've learned thanks to the contest:

- [Learned the basics Git and GitHub][task_git] (Yes, I hadn't been using them
  before!)
- [Created my Android first widget][task_widget1] and [made it display contacts
  from app's database][task_widget2].
- Had my [first contact with Angular][task_angular].
- Wrote a [blog post about getting started with Django][task_django].

And much more. There were lots of awesome tasks to do for everybody. If you
participate in GCI, you'll be surely by amazed by how much you've learned
through the contest.

**Fun fact** At the end of the contest, there were no Android tasks left for me
(I had done everything), so I came up with a few ideas and sent them to mentors.

# People

It may seem quite funny, but (at least in my opinion) the most important part of
Google Code-in isn't code, but people. Community. Mentors and students. Each of
them trying to the their best. It's incredibly motivating and greatly expands
one's horizons. When I had a problem I couldn't solve for a longer time, I just
asked other students and mentors for help and there was always somebody to give
that help. Although we were competing with each other, the atmosphere was very
nice and I could feel something I'd describe as the "spirit of brotherhood".

Now let me mention and thank a few people:

- Divyansh Kulshreshtha, for his awesome mentoring and advice
- Priyanka Jain, for awesome mentoring and fast task reviews
- Aayushman Choudhary, Raghav Awasthi, Roku234, IlyaMayer, Khukhuna, Lint, and
  Ribhav Sharma (the aspiring singer), for helping each other and having
  sometimes very funny and strange conversations üòÇ

# Time

The biggest problem during the contest. This year is my first in a high school
and it was difficult for me to stay competitive in GCI and not get a lot bad
grades.

# Health

I know few people who say they were working on tasks till 3AM and sleeping 4
hours a day. It seems impossible to live that way for me so I tried to sleep as
much as possible.

Also, sitting whole days had a negative impact on my condition. I'm not a very
sporty person, but I like running. Now, I can't even run 1km without losing my
breath. Fortunately, spring is coming üòé

After all, health is important.

# The End

And that's it. Hope you liked my post. Maybe it even encouraged you to take part
in Google-Code in 2019?

I'd also like to thank my family, girlfriend and friends for supporting me.
Also, thank you, my parents, for understanding _why do I sit so long at the
computer_.

Oh... I almost forgot to finish the story from the beginning of the post. The
email I got on that lazy and quiet winter morning said

![Yessss!](/assets/gci-2018/Final email.avif)

I'm very happy with the result, especially because the competition was pretty
hard. Hoping to perform even better next year!
