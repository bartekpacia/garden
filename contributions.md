I contribute to open-source a lot.

This page is a non-exclusive list of my contributions that I decided are worth
sharing here, be it because they were interesting, impactful, or any other
reason.

Contribution != pull request. Oftentimes, writing a detailed issue or feature
request and discussing it with project's stakeholders and other users takes much
more effort than just pumping out some code. The larger the project is, the more
impactful writing becomes.

### Shell completions for Cirrus CI command-line tools

I am a fan of Cirrus CI and think it's the most well thought-out CI system. When
I first started using it, I was annoyed by the lack of shell completions in
various CLI tools made by Cirrus, so I implemented it
