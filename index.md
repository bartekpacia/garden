Hello there.

I'm Bartek and this is my digital garden - my very own place on the World Wide
Web. You'll find here my thoughts on different topics, random notes, and
(sometimes) even a coherent, longer article.

I'm a software developer, currently on a break from work. In my free time
maintain and contribute to open-source software.

I like simplicity, consistency, and minimalism, and strive to exercise these in
my work and life.
