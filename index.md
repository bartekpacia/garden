Hello there.

I'm Bartek and this is my digital garden - my own place on the World Wide Web.
You'll here find my thoughts on different topics, or (sometimes) longer
articles.

It could be called a blog, but I'll not use this word since this word has always
been putting too much pressure on me, and I ended up accumulating endless "not
good enough" write-ups in my Notion.

I reserve the right to update contents of my articles at any time, but I will
not break URLs.

This site contains no ads, no trackers, no cookies, and no bullshit.

Semper fi.
