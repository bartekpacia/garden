Hello there.

I'm Bartek and this is my digital garden - my own place on the World Wide Web.
You'll find here my thoughts on different topics, or (sometimes) longer
articles, and random notes.

I'm a software developer. Currently I work at [LeanCode]. Outside work, I use,
maintain, and contribute to open-source software.

I like simplicity, consistency, and minimalism, and strive to exercise these in
my work and life.

This site contains no ads, no trackers, no cookies, and no bullshit.
